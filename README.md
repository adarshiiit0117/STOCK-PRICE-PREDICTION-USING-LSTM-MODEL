# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-LSTM-MODEL
This project aims to predict the closing price of a stock using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It uses 10 years of historical stock data scraped from Yahoo Finance. The data is split into 70% for training and 30% for testing, ensuring the model can generalize well to unseen data.
